Thia is an attempt at comparing the different activation functions in two scenarios, a neuroevolution flappybird variation of the codings train falppy bird cahllenge. And a regression scenario, in which the ANN is supposed to predict, given a huge dataset of points equally spaced,  another differnet random point.
